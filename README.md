# Innovation Team Sub-Agents - Starter Pack

A focused collection of 3 essential AI agents designed for fast-moving innovation teams. Built for rapid prototyping, validated learning, and creating professional presentations that command executive attention.

## üì• Installation

1. **Download this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/innovation-agents.git
   ```

2. **Copy to your Claude Code agents directory:**
   ```bash
   cp -r innovation-agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
   ```
   
   Or manually copy all the agent files to your `~/.claude/agents/` directory.

3. **Restart Claude Code** to load the new agents.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Agents are automatically available in Claude Code. Simply describe your innovation challenge and the appropriate agent will be triggered. You can also explicitly request an agent by mentioning their name.

### Example Usage
- "We think busy parents would pay for AI meal planning, but we're not sure" ‚Üí `rapid-validator`
- "We need to test if users understand our onboarding flow" ‚Üí `prototype-planner`
- "Turn our Q4 financial results into a board presentation" ‚Üí `strategic-presentation-architect`
- "Can we build real-time collaboration features in 2 weeks?" ‚Üí `prototype-planner`

## üìÅ Agent Categories

### Essential Innovation Workflow (`core/`)
The 3 most critical agents for innovation teams:
- **rapid-validator** - Test assumptions fast and cheap with maximum learning
- **prototype-planner** - Match prototype approach to learning objectives with AI tool recommendations
- **strategic-presentation-architect** - Transform data into executive-ready HTML presentations

## üìã Complete Agent List

### Core Innovation Workflow
- **rapid-validator** - Validate ideas, assumptions, and prototypes with minimal resources
- **prototype-planner** - Plan rapid prototyping approaches with optimal AI tool selection
- **strategic-presentation-architect** - Create professional HTML presentations with interactive charts

## üéØ Design Philosophy

These agents are built for innovation teams that need to:

### Speed & Velocity
- Move from assumption to validated learning in hours/days, not weeks
- Eliminate tool selection paralysis with instant AI tool recommendations
- Generate clear business signals quickly with minimal investment

### Executive Communication
- Transform raw data into board-ready presentations in minutes
- Create professional deliverables that rival expensive consulting work
- Build credibility with stakeholders through high-quality outputs

### Learning Optimization
- Test the riskiest assumptions first with systematic experimentation
- Match prototype fidelity to specific learning objectives
- Balance speed with quality of insights

### Resource Efficiency
- Use existing AI tools (v0, Lovable, Bolt, Cursor, Claude Artifacts) optimally
- Minimize waste on over-engineered or under-engineered prototypes
- Maximize learning per dollar spent

## üí° Best Practices

### Agent Collaboration Patterns
- **Validation ‚Üí Prototyping**: `rapid-validator` designs experiments ‚Üí `prototype-planner` builds the right prototype type
- **Research ‚Üí Presentation**: Gather insights ‚Üí `strategic-presentation-architect` creates executive summary
- **Data ‚Üí Decision**: `strategic-presentation-architect` transforms analysis into compelling narrative for stakeholders

### Innovation Velocity Tips
- **Start with validation** before building anything substantial
- **Use AI tools optimally** - let prototype-planner choose the right tool for your goal
- **Focus on learning speed** over feature completeness
- **Create executive-ready outputs** that drive strategic decisions
- **Measure assumptions tested** not just features built

## üîß Technical Details

### Agent Structure
Each agent includes:
- **name**: Unique identifier for Claude Code
- **description**: When to use with specific usage examples
- **tools**: Access to web_search, repl, google_drive_search, etc.
- **System prompt**: Comprehensive expertise and methodology (500-900 words)

### AI Tool Integration
The `prototype-planner` includes intelligent recommendations for:
- **v0**: Quick React components and UI testing
- **Lovable**: Full-stack apps with backend and database
- **Bolt**: Interactive demos and presentations
- **Cursor**: AI-assisted development for complex logic
- **Claude Artifacts**: Data visualization and algorithm testing
- **Replit**: Collaborative development and experimentation

### Professional Output Generation
The `strategic-presentation-architect` creates:
- **Interactive HTML presentations** with Reveal.js framework
- **Chart.js visualizations** from uploaded data files
- **Premium design** with consulting-grade styling
- **Mobile-responsive** presentations that work anywhere
- **Self-contained files** ready for immediate sharing

### Usage Examples
Every agent includes detailed usage examples showing:
- Real team conversations that would trigger the agent
- Specific, actionable outputs the agent provides
- Context about why that example matters for innovation teams

## üìä Success Metrics
