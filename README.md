# Innovation Team Sub-Agents - Complete Toolkit

A focused collection of 5 essential AI agents designed for fast-moving innovation teams. Built for rapid prototyping, validated learning, executive communication, systematic feature development, and world-class documentation.

## üì• Installation

1. **Download this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kellyoconor/next_agents.git
   ```

2. **Copy to your Claude Code agents directory:**
   ```bash
   cp -r next_agents/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
   ```
   
   Or manually copy all the agent files to your `~/.claude/agents/` directory.

3. **Restart Claude Code** to load the new agents.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Agents are automatically available in Claude Code. Simply describe your innovation challenge and the appropriate agent will be triggered. You can also explicitly request an agent by mentioning their name.

## üìã Complete Agent List

### Core Innovation Workflow
- **rapid-validator** - Validate ideas, assumptions, and prototypes with minimal resources
- **prototype-planner** - Plan rapid prototyping approaches with optimal AI tool selection
- **strategic-presentation-architect** - Create professional HTML presentations with interactive charts
- **ai-dev-task-master** - Break down complex features into structured development workflows
- **stripe-docs-expert** - Write crystal-clear documentation with practical, working examples

## üéØ Design Philosophy

These agents are built for innovation teams that need to:

### Speed & Velocity
- Move from assumption to validated learning in hours/days, not weeks
- Eliminate tool selection paralysis with instant AI tool recommendations
- Generate clear business signals quickly with minimal investment

### Executive Communication
- Transform raw data into board-ready presentations in minutes
- Create professional deliverables that rival expensive consulting work
- Build credibility with stakeholders through high-quality outputs

### Systematic Development
- Break complex features into manageable, structured tasks
- Provide step-by-step implementation guidance with quality checkpoints
- Maintain progress visibility and completion tracking

### Documentation Excellence
- Create documentation that users actually enjoy reading
- Eliminate support burden through clear, self-service guides
- Increase feature adoption with Stripe-quality developer experience

### Learning Optimization
- Test the riskiest assumptions first with systematic experimentation
- Match prototype fidelity to specific learning objectives
- Balance speed with quality of insights

### Resource Efficiency
- Use existing AI tools (v0, Lovable, Bolt, Cursor, Claude Artifacts) optimally
- Minimize waste on over-engineered or under-engineered prototypes
- Maximize learning per dollar spent

## üí° Best Practices

### Agent Collaboration Patterns
- **Validation ‚Üí Prototyping**: `rapid-validator` designs experiments ‚Üí `prototype-planner` builds the right prototype type
- **Research ‚Üí Presentation**: Gather insights ‚Üí `strategic-presentation-architect` creates executive summary
- **Planning ‚Üí Development**: `prototype-planner` validates approach ‚Üí `ai-dev-task-master` structures implementation
- **Development ‚Üí Documentation**: `ai-dev-task-master` builds features ‚Üí `stripe-docs-expert` creates amazing guides
- **Data ‚Üí Decision**: `strategic-presentation-architect` transforms analysis into compelling narrative for stakeholders

### Complete Innovation-to-Implementation-to-Launch Pipeline
**Real workflow example:**
1. **rapid-validator** - "Test if users want AI expense tracking"
2. **prototype-planner** - "Build validation prototype using v0 + Lovable"  
3. **strategic-presentation-architect** - "Present results to executive team"
4. **ai-dev-task-master** - "Build production feature with systematic task breakdown"
5. **stripe-docs-expert** - "Create comprehensive API documentation and user guides"

**Timeline:** Idea ‚Üí Validated prototype ‚Üí Executive buy-in ‚Üí Production feature ‚Üí Launch-ready documentation in weeks, not months

### Innovation Velocity Tips
- **Start with validation** before building anything substantial
- **Use AI tools optimally** - let prototype-planner choose the right tool for your goal
- **Focus on learning speed** over feature completeness
- **Create executive-ready outputs** that drive strategic decisions
- **Structure complex development** with systematic task management
- **Document for adoption** - great features need great docs to succeed
- **Measure assumptions tested** not just features built
