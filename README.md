# next_agents
A specialized collection of AI agents designed for a fast-moving innovation team. Built for AI-first organizations using dynamic pod structures (Velocity, Adjacent, Moonshot, Enablement) with a focus on rapid prototyping, validated learning, and impact velocity.
**üì• Installation**
Download this repository:

git clone https://github.com/kellyoconor/next_agents.git
Copy to your Claude Code agents directory:

cp -r agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
Or manually copy all the agent files to your ~/.claude/agents/ directory.

Restart Claude Code to load the new agents.

**üöÄ Quick Start**
Agents are automatically available in Claude Code. Simply describe your task and the appropriate agent will be triggered. You can also explicitly request an agent by mentioning their name.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

These agents are built for innovation teams that need to:

### Speed & Velocity
- Move from concept to validated prototype in days/weeks, not months
- Run multiple promising threads in parallel
- Generate clear business signals quickly

### AI-First Operations
- Prove AI cannot do the job before adding resources
- Expand expertise through AI augmentation rather than hiring
- Focus human effort on creative and strategic work

### Dynamic Pod Structure
- Flow talent to innovation opportunities as they emerge
- Share learnings across Velocity, Adjacent, Moonshot, and Enablement pods
- Maintain team cohesion through fluid organizational boundaries

### Validated Learning
- Test assumptions systematically with minimal investment
- Balance exploitation of known successes with exploration of new opportunities
- Make data-driven decisions about pivoting, persevering, or killing initiatives

## üí° Best Practices

### Agent Collaboration Patterns
1. **Research ‚Üí Prototype ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Iterate**
   - `problem-solution-finder` ‚Üí `prototype-planner` ‚Üí `rapid-validator` ‚Üí `iteration-advisor`

2. **Technical Feasibility Check**
   - `technical-feasibility-assessor` works with any other agent when building is involved

3. **Business Case Development**
   - `business-signal-synthesizer` + `impact-velocity-tracker` for executive communication

4. **Resource Optimization**
   - `pod-resource-orchestrator` + `ai-capability-amplifier` for team efficiency

### Innovation Velocity Tips
- **Start with validation** before building anything substantial
- **Use AI augmentation** before hiring additional specialists  
- **Focus on learning speed** over feature completeness
- **Measure business signals** not just user engagement
- **Share insights across pods** to prevent duplicate work
